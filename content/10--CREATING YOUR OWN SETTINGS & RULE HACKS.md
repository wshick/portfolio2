# CREATING YOUR OWN SETTINGS & RULE HACKS
When you create a setting or new rules for a Micro Construct Tactics Nova game like Mobile Frame Zero, you need to come to agreement with your friends so **you’re all playing the same game with the same expectations**.

## Aesthetic Questions
- **Are there any unusual features you want?** Maybe the battles are fought with tanks and infantry rather than robots? Maybe they’re giant monsters? Autonomous robots? Tree-men and goblins? Spearmen, slingers, archers, and elephants?
- **What is the range of the conflict?** A city-state? A kingdom? A nation, planet, solar system, galaxy?
- **When does this take place?** Does it take place in an alternate timeline of the Solar Calendar? Is it in a fantastic, historical place? Is it in some other future?
- **How big is a human?** A single stud? A stud on a brick? Two bricks? A stud on two bricks? A Minifig?
- **What do you expect a weapon system to look like?** What’s a single hand-to-hand attachment look like? What about direct? What about artillery? When you double them, what might they be? How big are they?
- **What counts as a yellow (communication) system?** A battle flag? A war horn? A sensor dome? Be flexible with each other and encourage creativity within the parameters of your setting.
- **What counts as a green (movement) system?** A jet pack? Skis? Extra legs? Be flexible with each other and encourage creativity within the parameters of your setting.
- **What counts as a blue (defense) system?** A shield? Stealth cladding? Be flexible with each other and encourage creativity within the parameters of your setting.

## Rules Questions
- **How far is direct fire range?** Remember that most frames can move a maximum of 6 units and some can move up to 7 or 8 a quarter of the time. If you make direct fire range more units, it will make both artillery and hand-to-hand less useful because there will be less area covered by artillery, and frames armed with hand-to-hand weapons will have a harder time traversing the distance of direct fire range without getting shot twice.
- **How far is hand-to-hand range?** If it's greater than 1, it will reduce the value of direct fire range weapons while making hand-to-hand easier to use.
- **How big is a unit of measurement?** If you make units bigger while keeping the same scale of table, frame, and cover, it means that artillery will become less important because it will lose area off the edge of the table as direct range gets longer. Hand-to-hand will also become more important because the area within 1 unit of a frame gets bigger proportionate to the square of the radius. It will also mean that it will be easier to move across open area, so you might consider putting your cover farther apart.
- **Are there a different number of ranges?** More ranges will mean that there will be fewer opportunities to do damage, encouraging players to design frames that specialize at a range. Fewer ranges mean that it will be easier to do damage without making choices to do it.
- **When cover takes a hit, how many pieces do you remove?** If you remove more than six, players will have to move their frames constantly to stay in cover and will take more damage at direct and artillery range, making it harder to capture objectives. If you remove fewer, cover will be safer, which will make it easier to rely on as you plan a battle, but might encourage players to hold their frames in place.
- **Do frames without ranged weapons move faster?** If they get a green d8 (as by the basic rules), they’ll be easier to keep in formation and will move forward faster than more heavily armed frames. If they don’t get that bonus, they will take more hits on the way to attack a target, making them a less viable type of frame.
- **Do hand-to-hand weapons do more damage than ranged weapons?** If they work like they do in the basic rules (hitting on a 4, 5, or 6), the extra damage they inflict makes it worth traversing the dangerous distance to the target. If you make them do the same damage as ranged weapons, more of a fight will take place at range, with the capture of objectives only taking place when it’s safe for an attacker to advance.
- **Can all units spot?** If units with no yellow dice can spot through cover, they will spot more often, though usually with a 1 or 2. If they can't spot at all without a yellow die, the yellow dice in a company will become very valuable, making an interesting and hard choice for players. Frames will tend to take less damage, making it safer to run out of cover.
- **At what range can you spot?** If you spot at hand-to-hand range instead of direct, it will encourage players to dive into close combat more and will reduce the effectiveness of ranged attacks.
- **Can a frame with two yellow dice instead spot two frames instead of spotting anywhere on the board?** This will put more yellow dice on the table in your favor but you’ll need to get scouts to the front, rather than having a commander spot from a safe distance.
- **Does a second blue die allow a frame to safely provide cover as in the basic rules?** If not, while it’s valuable to have a second blue die, it will almost always be better to equip a frame with a more active type of system--yellow, red, or green.
- **Are there special design parameters?** E.g., must there be at least one yellow die in each company? Must every unit carry at least one hand-to-hand weapon? Are ranged weapons limited in number?
- **Is there a maximum number of frames less than eight?** If the maximum is fewer, play will be faster and more tense, though there will be fewer strategic options.
- **Does something give a frame extra dice?** What circumstances, exactly, can all players use to gain those dice? Are they something at design time or do those dice happen in play?

## A Few Non-Obvious Effects of Changing Effectiveness
You might want to change the way the numbers work in your Micro Construct Tactics games. Here are some (but certainly not all) things to think about as you determine how you want the game to work. 

You might want to implement such changes only circumstantially, giving a bonus or penalty according to a frame’s position on the board or the doomsday clock, for instance.

### Defense
**Increasing the effectiveness of defense** will slow play; games will take much longer to play, but there will be fewer upsets because it will be more attractive to play defensively than aggressively. Ultimately, this will favor the defender. It also increases the need for yellow dice.

**Decreasing the effectiveness of defense** will make games faster, but if taken too far, there will be more upsets, reducing the effect of strong tactical play. It will also reduce the necessity of yellow dice, favoring large weapons and requiring more blue dice or more hiding behind cover.

### Spotting
**Increasing the effectiveness of spotting** will favor teamwork between frames. If you increase the range of spotting, players will simply use any spare dice to spot any time, decreasing the necessary teamwork. It will also reduce the “fog of war”, making the game more deterministic and reducing the opportunities to take risks.

**Decreasing the effectiveness of spotting** will make it hard to do damage to a frame. The risks of standing out of cover will be lower, favoring heedless charges into fire. It will increase the “fog of war” effect, making attacks more random in effectiveness.

### Attacking
**Increasing the effectiveness of attacks** enhances the need for cover. This will favor the player who needs to move least: the defender.

**Decreasing the effectiveness of attacks** makes it less risky to move forward, favoring the attackers. If decreased excessively, it will make it prohibitively difficult to play defense.

### Moving
**Making frames faster** will make closing on opponents take fewer turns. It will be easier to take unguarded stations, as well, causing more upsets. Frames may be able to close faster than direct range, which means hand-to-hand may become more viable.

**Making frame movement more reliable** will make it easier for players to keep their frames in formation, encouraging that kind of company construction. If there are fewer ways to fall out of formation, it will reduce the “fog of war” effect of the game, making the game more deterministic.

**Decreasing the effectiveness of movement** will make the game more decisive, as frames either get stuck in the open or simply can’t make it far enough to change course on a standard-sized table. It may favor play on a smaller table! Perhaps it would be better to reduce the size of a measurement unit instead.

### Cover
**Increasing the durability of cover** will encourage players to keep frames in cover. If you place more of it, though, they’ll still be able to run from cover to cover. 

**Increasing the effectiveness of cover** by, for instance, making it impossible to spot through will result in less damage at direct and artillery ranges and therefore more fights at hand-to-hand range.

### Try it!
If you make changes like these, consider the rules they interact with, then try them out! Let us all know how it worked!

### Some rules you’ll be tempted by but are hereby advised to avoid:
- Don't give anyone numerical modifiers. They’re boring and hard to remember. Instead, give an extra colored die--a 6-sided die or an 8-sided die--as a modifier.
- Don’t increase the number of white dice. They make the design of frames less important, reducing the effect of the players’ design choices.
- Don’t do anything that increases the effect of defense. It reduces the effect of the players’ tactical choices and makes the game take longer while reducing the number of valid choices in that time. Rapid Attack!
- Likewise, don’t institute a repair system that takes place during a skirmish or battle. It reduces the effect of bold offensives, which means wise players will make fewer of them. It also encourages players to completely destroy frames because they can come back, invalidating the choice to let an enemy frame run.
- Don’t make yellow dice affect a frame’s own attack. It’s better to give bigger red dice to an attacker. Yellow dice are to connect frames to each other, benefitting players whose frames work together, whichever side they’re on.
- Don’t use powers that require a frame to stand still, not acting for a turn. The cost is higher than it might appear and it slows the game substantially.
