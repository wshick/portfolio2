# FIELDING COMPANIES
Field your companies: **defense** to **offense** to **defense**.

## Initial Defense
**The player with the highest starting score places their stations.** In this example, that’s Sebastian.

**If you’re the initial defender**, place your stations wherever you want, but **within direct fire range of one another**.

If you're fielding 3 stations, the third must be within direct fire range of either of the first two; it doesn't have to be within direct fire range of both.

You have a **defensive perimeter**: only you can place your mobile frames within direct fire range of any of your stations.

**Place two of your mobile frames.** Place them within your perimeter, but otherwise, wherever you like.

It’s probably to your advantage to place them at the advance edge of your perimeter.

On some battlefields, under some circumstances, it might be possible for you to arrange your initial setup in such a way that the offensive players can’t legally field their own forces. If you find that you've done this, go back and change your mobile frames’ positions so the game can go forward.

## Initial Offense
**The point offensive player**--the player with the lowest starting score--**goes second**. In this example, that's Joshua.

**If you're the initial offense**, place one of your mobile frames:
- **outside** the defensive player's perimeter
- **at the limit of--but within--direct fire range** of one of the defensive player's mobile frames
- out of cover

This is the **point mobile frame**.

## Continuing Offense
**All offensive players alternate**, mobile frame by mobile frame, until all the offensive players' mobile frames are on the field.

On each of your turns, place one of your mobile frames. Place it:
- outside the defensive player's perimeter
- outside direct fire range of any of the defensive player's mobile frames
- otherwise, wherever you like

**Once all the offensive players' mobile frames are on the field**, alternate again, placing your stations.

On each of your turns, place one of your stations. Try not to place it within direct fire range of any opponents' mobile frames, but this might not always be possible.

## Final Defense
**The player with the highest starting score finishes.** In this case, that's Sebastian.

**If you're the initial defender**, place your remaining mobile frames on the battlefield. **Place them wherever you want**, but if you place them outside of your perimeter, place them in cover.

## Fielding Example
**The battle starts now**, at the moment the point mobile frame exposed itself to fire.

**Sebastian, fielding The Piercing Eye, has the highest starting score, 42, so he starts play on defense.** He starts by fielding both his stations and 2 of his mobile frames.

His strategy will be to **abandon one station to Joshua and retreat** into position around the other, to mount a counterattack later in the game when Joshua and Vincent have softened each other up for him. Accordingly, **he places one station in a relatively exposed position, at A, and the other in a more secure position, at B**. He establishes his perimeter by placing his first **two mobile frames at C and D, in cover near A in a place that will make for an easy retreat when the time comes.**

**Joshua, fielding Estar's Anvil, has the lowest starting score, 21, so he starts on point offense.** He fields the point mobile frame. It has to be out of cover and within direct fire range of one of Sebastian's mobile frames at C or D.

Estar’s Anvil is an unstoppable machine, but not quick on its feet, so Joshua decides to **deploy them in a crushing wall along the line**, as best he can manage, created by Seb’s two stations. That way he can hope to seize one and continue on without breaking stride to assault the other. **He places his point mobile frame at E.**

**Now Vincent and Joshua alternate placing frames.** Vincent’s starting score, 36, is quite strong. If Joshua seizes one of Sebastian’s stations, that’ll put Vincent in the lead, so **his strategy is to deploy defensively** in the expectation that this will happen.

**Ultimately he places his four mobile frames in a nice defensive line at F, H, J and L.**

**Joshua places his remaining four mobile frames at G, I, K, and M**, completing his anvil.

**Now Joshua and Vincent place their stations**, Joshua first. He knows that he can’t make the hard, direct assault he needs to while also defending his stations, but also that his stations won’t be high-priority targets, so **he places them in out of the way spots, N and O**, and wishes them good luck.

Vincent, on the other hand, expects to have to fight to defend his stations, and so **he’s left room for them behind his company. He places them at P and Q.**

Finally, **Sebastian places his last two mobile frames**. He considers placing them in ambush--in cover outside of his perimeter--but decides instead to stick to his plan. **He places them in harrying retreat positions at R and S.**

**The battle starts now!**

## Doomsday
**The battle ends after a variable number of rounds.**

Place a distinctive d12 or d20 somewhere safe, where everyone can see it, set to 11. This is the doomsday clock.

At the end of every round, the doomsday clock counts down by 1 (or more, when a player wants). When it reaches 0--doomsday--the battle ends, and the player with the highest score wins. Ties are possible, but unlikely.
