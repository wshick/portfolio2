# BASIC CAMPAIGN RULES
## One battle doesn’t often settle an issue.
Sometimes a planet, system, transit gate, or political ideology doesn’t change hands until after an extended conflict. Such a conflict is composed of many battles, and together those are called a campaign.

These rules will not help you resolve the outcome of such a campaign, but they will give you a way to establish continuity between games.

## If you’re playing a campaign game, do the following:
**Add a single “special objective” to the game.** Name it. Is it a popular religious, industrial, or political leader that one side wants to hold responsible and another wants as a figurehead? A prototype mobile frame? A spaceport that is the last connection to the transit gate?

Place it by consensus after everyone has placed all their frames.
- At the end of the game, at doomsday 0, whoever has the special objective keeps its points, as normal.
- Whether or not the player who owns that objective won the game, they can now determine characteristics for the next game.

When you find yourself in possession of the special objective at the end of the game, you can **do any two** of these things:
- **Set an environmental constraint** to some or all of the table. Any frame in the special environment needs to have a special environment system in order to have both their white dice. Tell everyone before they’ve assembled their company for the game. For instance, if the battle is taking place at the edge of the ocean, frames with an underwater system (air tanks or impeller thrusters) work normally in the water, where **frames that don’t have that kind of system only get one white die** while they’re in the ocean. If the battle is taking place in space, frames with rockets or a gyro system get a second white die while in space. If on an ice planet, only those with a heating system backpack get the second white die.
- **Determine a design constraint.** You may determine that no one may use a certain kind of system, like communication. For example, there's a heavy, magnetic fog that makes it so no one can use yellow dice. Or perhaps all parties are out of ammunition and are fighting over a supply depot, so no one can use direct- or artillery-ranged weapons. Or maybe acid rain has attacked all the frames’ armor, meaning no one can have blue dice. You may also determine unilaterally the number of single-shot rockets each team may use.
- **Determine a reduced average number of systems per frame.** For instance, if you determine that frames can mount an average of three systems, a company of four frames can have twelve systems, though that might mean that one frame has four systems and another has two.
- **Determine if the game will be a skirmish-scale game or a full-size battle.**

### Some fun things to do with the special objective:
- **Make it follow orders.** Whichever player owns the objective may move it 1 die in any direction once per round.
- **Make it follow its owner.** When the owner moves, the special objective moves with them as long as they don’t have to cross cover (including other frames) to do it. It can’t leave the table unless the owning frame leaves with it.
- **Make it afraid.** Once per round, everyone but the current owner can, on their initiative, move it by one in any direction.

### If you’re thinking about making rules for how to settle a longer campaign, here’s some advice:
- Don’t change a player’s number of dice or frames overall as a consequence of a battle. **Winning a battle should not give a tactical advantage to any player in the next battle.**
- If you’re going to score the battles, **don’t make scores rely on previous wins and losses.**
