# RESOLVING ATTACKS
## Does the Attack Strike Home?
If there is a spot on your target, you may choose to **add its value directly to your attack**. Remove that spot die from the field. **It doesn’t matter who placed the spot.** You can use anybody’s spot, and anybody can use yours.

**Compare your attack die** to your target’s defense die.

**If your target’s defense equals or beats your attack**, the attack misses. It’s resolved; continue with your turn.

**If your attack (including spot) beats your target’s defense**, the attack hits.

## How Much Damage?
**Roll a number of damage dice equal to your attack value (including spot) minus your target’s defense value.** For damage dice, color doesn’t matter.

Each die you roll might inflict damage.

Choose the appropriate damage chart based on weapon range and cover.

Recall that a mobile frame is in cover against an attacker if it is within hand to hand range of terrain or a structure on the battlefield that is between it and its attacker, in whole or in part.

### Damage chart 1: hand-to-hand attacks
**Hand-to-hand attacks ignore cover.**

| Roll |   Result   |
|:----:|:----------:|
| 1-3  |    MISS    |
| 4-6  | HIT TARGET |

### Damage chart 2: ranged attack, no cover
For direct fire or artillery attacks, target not in cover.

| Roll |   Result   |
|:----:|:----------:|
| 1-4  |    MISS    |
| 5-6  | HIT TARGET |

### Damage chart 3: ranged attack, normal cover
For direct fire or artillery attacks, target in cover.

| Roll |   Result   |
|:----:|:----------:|
| 1-3  |    MISS    |
| 4-5  | HIT COVER  |
|  6   | HIT TARGET |

**Apply damage to cover first**: 4s and 5s before 6s. If the cover's destroyed mid-process, switch to **damage chart 2**. Any 5s left blow through the destroyed cover to hit the target mobile frame.

### Damage chart 4: ranged attack, covered by a mobile frame
For direct fire or artillery attacks, when a mobile frame covers the target.

| Roll |   Result   |
|:----:|:----------:|
| 1-4  |    MISS    |
|  5   | HIT COVER  |
|  6   | HIT TARGET |

**Apply damage to the covering mobile frame first**: 5s before 6s. If the covering frame is destroyed mid-process, switch to **damage chart 2**. Any 5s left blow through the destroyed frame to hit the target mobile frame.

**If the covering mobile frame has 2 defensive systems, it takes no damage.** A second defensive system allows a mobile frame to provide cover without risking damage.

### Damage chart 5: attacks against terrain
For any attack in which the target is not a mobile frame.

| Roll |   Result   |
|:----:|:----------:|
| 1-3  |    MISS    |
| 4-6  | HIT TARGET |

## When Terrain Takes Damage
**For each damage it takes, it loses 6 pieces.** The attacker chooses which pieces. Recall that structures fewer than 3 bricks high do not count as cover.

## When a Mobile Frame Takes Damage
**For each damage it takes, it loses one of its systems.** Its **owner** chooses which system it loses. Pop it off the frame and drop it on the field. Since that system's gone, it doesn’t provide its die or dice in any future turns.

**If it has no systems left**, it loses one of its white dice.

**If it loses both its white dice**, it’s destroyed.

**If it is within hand to hand range of a station**, its owner can choose to have it ignore one damage and instead abandon its position, moving the mobile frame 1 ruler unit away from the station.

**Taking damage doesn’t affect the dice you’ve already rolled unless the frame is destroyed.** They’re yours to use until the end of this mobile frame’s turn.

### When one of your mobile frames is destroyed:
You lose points for it, so **recalculate your score now**.

**The attack’s resolved!** Continue with your turn.

## Example Attack
- **Joshua’s playing point offense**, and his point mobile frame, an ST-10 Osprey operated by Captain Kader, is coming under attack. **It’s already been spotted** by the first of Sebastian's mobile frames, the scrambler Ghanat Doajihé, and now **the second of Sebastian’s mobile frames, the scrambler Ghanat Ekauechihé, is following through**.
- Joshua's defense: B5
- Sebastian's attack: R3
- The spot: Y5
- R3 + Y5 - B5 = **3 damage dice**
- Joshua’s mobile frame is in cover behind a ragged wall, so he rolls his 3 damage dice on damage chart 3.
- Roll: **1, 4, 5**
- The 1 counts for nothing; **the 4 and the 5 are hits**.
- **First the 4 hits the cover.** When terrain takes damage, each hit lets the attacker break off 6 bricks. As it happens, this is enough to blow a hole in the wall big enough to ruin it for cover. **The 5 blows through the ruined cover and hits the target behind it**, inflicting 1 damage to Joshua’s mobile frame. This means that Joshua has to destroy one of its systems: its grenade launcher (2Rd), its sensor pod (1Y), its body armor (1B), or its shield (1B). He pops off its shield and leaves it among the scattered bricks of the smashed wall.

>[!question]- Can the attacker make the attack, even though it's a close judgement call?
> **Yes!** When it comes to whether an attack is legitimate, be generous to the attacker.
