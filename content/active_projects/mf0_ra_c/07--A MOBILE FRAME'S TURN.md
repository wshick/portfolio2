# A MOBILE FRAME'S TURN
1. **Name** your target.
2. **Gather and roll** your dice.
3. **Defend.**
4. **Assign** your dice.
5. **Move** then **attack** or **attack** then **move**.
6. **Spot.**

## 1. Naming Your Target
Name one mobile frame to be the target of your attack.

If you have an artillery weapon system, you can name a target at artillery range.

If you have a direct fire weapon system, or you're firing single-shot rockets, you can name a target at direct fire range.

You can name a target at hand to hand range even if you have no hand to hand weapon system.

You can name no target, if you prefer not to make an attack.

You can name a piece of terrain as a target, instead of a mobile frame, if you like. You can’t name a station as a target, however.

**If you have weapon systems at more than one range**, when you name your target, name which range you’ll be attacking from. **You have to commit to your attack range when you name your target** so that you know which weapon system’s dice to roll.

Since you’ll have the option to move before you attack, you can name a target that is currently out of range. When the time comes, **if you manage to cross the necessary distance, you may attack**. If you fail to cross the distance, you forgo the attack.

## 2. Gathering and Rolling Your Dice
Recall that:
- **Your mobile frame** gives you 2 white dice.
- Each **defensive system** adds 1 **blue** die.
- Each **movement system** adds 1 **green** die.
- Each **surveillance/communications system** adds 1 **yellow** die.
- One **weapon system at the appropriate range** adds **2 red** dice.
- A **second weapon system at the appropriate range** adds 1 **red 8-sided** die.
- Each **single-shot rocket you're firing** adds 1 **red 8-sided** die.

**If your mobile frame has no direct fire or artillery weapon systems** either because it had none to begin with or has lost them, add 1 green 8-sided die.

Pick up the appropriate assortment of dice and **roll them all at once**.

As you defend, move, attack and spot, you’ll **assign your dice to those actions**. The principle is this:
- **blue** to **defend**
- **green** to **move**
- **red** to **attack**
- **yellow** to **spot**
- **white** are **wild**.

You get to roll up front, look at the numbers you’ve rolled, and decide where you’ll swap in your white dice.

When you assign a die, you’ve used it up, you can’t assign it again to another action. Once you've taken all 4 actions, discard all your leftover dice.

## 3. Defending Yourself
**Assign a blue die or a white die to your defense.** If you don’t have any defensive systems, you didn’t roll any blue dice, so choose a white die or forgo your defense.

**Place a blue die** on the battlefield next to the mobile frame, either the blue you rolled or a white die turned to your defense value. **This is this mobile frame’s defense for the entire round**; you won’t change it until next round.

If you assigned no die to defense, your defense is 0.

**If you rolled your frame’s dice because have an attack outstanding against you, resolve the attack now.** Wait for your attacker to finish its turn before you continue yours.

## 4. Moving Then Attacking, or Attacking Then Moving
You choose whether to attack before you move or move before you attack.

### When you move:
**Assign a green die or a white die to your movement.** If you didn’t roll any green dice, choose a white die or forgo movement.

**Move a number of ruler units** equal to the result of your movement die or less.

If you assigned no die to movement, you can’t move.

**If you have any movement systems or if you rolled the green 8-sided die for carrying no ranged weapons**, you can pass through cover as though it weren’t there. Otherwise, you have to go around it.

Recall that any structure on the battlefield at least 3 bricks high counts as cover, including mobile frames but excluding stations.

### When you attack:
**Is your target within the range you declared?** If so, proceed with your attack. Otherwise, forgo your attack.

**Assign a red die or a white die to your attack.** If you don’t have any weapon systems at the appropriate range, you didn’t roll any red dice, so if your target is at hand-to-hand range, choose a white die or forgo your attack. **You can voluntarily abort your attack by choosing to assign no die to it.**

**If it is within range, resolve your attack now** against its standing defense and continue with your turn.

**If it doesn’t have a defense number, switch now to combat order.** Put your turn on hold until your target has its defense die. Once it does, resolve your attack and continue with your turn.

### Special cases:
If you assigned no die to your attack, you don’t make one.

If you are attacking a piece of cover, its defense is 0 and it is not in cover (even if there is cover available to it).

## 5. Finally, Spot
Assign a yellow die or a white die to your spot. If don’t have any surveillance/comms systems, you didn’t roll any yellow dice, so choose a white die or forgo your spot.

Declare the mobile frame you’re spotting.

**If you have no surveillance/comms systems**, it must be:
- within direct fire or hand-to-hand range
- out of cover

**If you have one surveillance/comms system**, it must be **within direct fire or hand-to-hand range**, but it **can** be in cover.

**If you have two surveillance/comms systems**, it can be any mobile frame on the field.

Recall that a mobile frame is in cover against an attacker if it is within hand to hand range of terrain or a structure on the battlefield, and the cover is between it and its attacker, in whole or in part.

**Place a yellow die next to your spotting target**, turned to the value of your spot die. If another frame has already spotted your target this round, it already has a yellow die next to it. **The high spot always stands.** Replace the existing spot only if your spot is higher.

Always **spot after you’ve made and resolved your attack**. You cannot spot first and follow it up with your own attack.

You can’t spot terrain or stations.

## Principled Judgement Calls
**Defending:** If it’s a close call, then yes, consider the defender to be in cover.

**Moving:** If it’s a close call, then yes, allow the mobile frame to move to that position.

**Attacking & Spotting:** If it’s a close call, then yes, consider the target to be in the
attacker’s preferred range.

**Measuring:** Anyone can measure anything on the table whenever they want.

**If this mobile frame is the only mobile frame within hand to hand range of a station, it seizes it.** Mark it as yours. **The opponent you seized it from loses points for it, and you gain points for it**, so both of you recalculate your tactical turn order now.

## Example Round
It's the first round of the battle between the UMFL company **Estar’s Anvil**, fielded by **Joshua**; the Free Colony company **Sun’s Fang**, fielded by **Vincent**; and the Ijad company **Piercing Eye**, fielded by **Sebastian**.

**The round begins in tactical order**, as always. Sebastian has the highest score, **so he has the tactical initiative**. His choice is to take one of his mobile frames’ turns or to pass to Vincent, who has the second highest score.

He chooses one of his forward mobile frames to take its turn.

### Turn: Sebastian's mobile frame #1
- Sebastian’s **Target**: Joshua's point mobile frame #1
- Sebastian’s **Dice**: 2W 2Rd 1G 2Y
- Sebastian’s **Roll**: W6 W2 R5 R1 G5 Y3 Y5
- Sebastian’s **Defense**: **W6**
- Sebastian’s **Attack**: **R5**

**Stop!** To resolve the attack, we need to know Joshua’s mobile frame’s defense, so we **switch to combat order**.

### Turn: Joshua's mobile frame #1
- Joshua’s **Target**: return fire at Sebastian's mobile frame #1
- Joshua’s **Dice**: 2W 2Rd 2B 1Y
- Joshua’s **Roll**: W5 W1 R2 R6 B4 B5 Y4
- Joshua’s **Defense**: **B5**

**Stop!** That’s all we need from Joshua’s mobile frame to resolve Sebastian’s attack.

### Turn: Sebastian's mobile frame #1, resuming
- Sebastian’s **Attack**: **R5** vs Defense **B5**: no hit, no damage
- Sebastian’s **Move**: **G5** (falling back toward the station at B)
- Sebastian’s **Spot**: **Y5** (spotting Joshua’s point mobile frame #1)

**End of Sebastian’s turn.**

We’re in combat order **with a mobile frame’s turn still outstanding**, so we resume it.

### Turn: Joshua's point mobile frame #1, resuming
- Joshua’s **Move**: **W5** (advancing to maintain range with its target)
- Sebastian's mobile frame #1 **already has a defense number**, so we can **resolve the attack uninterrupted**.
- Joshua’s **Attack**: **R6** vs Defense **W6**: no hit, no damage
- Joshua’s **Spot**: **Y4** (spotting Sebastian’s mobile frame #1)

**End of Joshua’s turn.**

**There are no mobile frames whose moves are still underway**, so combat order ends and we **return to tactical order**. Sebastian still has the high score, so he’s up. The last exchange drew Joshua’s mobile frame #1 well forward, and put a tasty Y5 spot on it, so he chooses one of his harrying mobile frames.

### Turn: Sebastian's frame #2
- Sebastian’s **Target**: Joshua’s mobile frame #1
- Sebastian’s **Dice**: 2W 2Rd 1G 1Y
- Sebastian’s **Roll**: W2 W4 R3 R3 G2 Y1
- Sebastian’s **Defense**: **W4**

Joshua's mobile frame #1 **already has a defense number**, so we can **resolve the attack** uninterrupted.

- Sebastian’s **Attack**: **R3+Y5** vs **B5**: hit for **3 damage dice**!
- Sebastian’s **Move**: **G2** (falling back slightly)
- Sebastian’s **Spot**: **Y1** (spotting Joshua’s mobile frame #1 again)

**End of Sebastian’s turn.**

**We’re still in tactical order** and Sebastian’s still up. He considers pressing the attack on Joshua’s single exposed mobile frame but decides that it’ll still be there later if he still wants it. Instead of taking his third mobile frame’s turn, **he passes**. **Vincent has the second highest score, so now it’s his choice:** choose a mobile frame to take its turn, or pass too? He chooses to have one of his rear heavy artillery mobile frames go.

### Turn: Vincent's frame #1
- Vincent’s **Target**: Sebastian's frame #3
- Vincent’s **Dice**: 2W 2Ra d8Ra 1B 1Y
- Vincent’s **Roll**: W4 W6 R1 R2 d8R5 B4 Y5
- Vincent’s **Defense**: **B4**
- Vincent’s **Attack**: **W6**

**Stop!** To resolve the attack, **we need to know Sebastian’s mobile frame’s defense**, so we **switch to combat order**.

### Turn: Sebastian's frame #3
- Sebastian’s **Target**: Joshua's frame #2
- Sebastian’s **Dice**: 2W 2Rd 1G 2Y
- Sebastian’s **Roll**: W5 W2 R2 R6 G4 Y6 Y5
- Sebastian’s **Defense**: **W5**

**Stop!** That’s all we need from Sebastian’s mobile frame to resolve Vincent’s attack.

### Turn: Vincent's frame #1, resuming
- Vincent’s **Attack**: **W6** vs **W5**: hit for **1 damage die**!
- Vincent’s **Move**: **W4** (backing up 1 to slightly better cover)
- Vincent’s **Spot**: **Y5** (but there’s no enemy mobile frame within range, so the spot’s wasted)

**End of Vincent’s turn.**

We’re in combat order with **a mobile frame’s turn still outstanding**, so we resume it.

### Turn: Sebastian's frame #3, resuming
- Sebastian’s **Move**: **G4** (advancing into range with Joshua's mobile frame #2, despite his plan to fall back)
- Sebastian’s **Attack**: **R6**

**Stop!** To resolve the attack, **we need to know Joshua’s mobile frame’s defense**, so we switch to its turn.

### Turn: Joshua's frame #2
- Joshua’s **Target**: Sebastian's frame #3
- Joshua’s **Dice**: 2W 2Rd 1B 1G 1Y
- Joshua’s **Roll**: W5 W4 R6 R3 B2 G6 Y5
- Joshua’s **Defense**: **W5**

**Stop!** That’s all we need from Joshua’s mobile frame to resolve Sebastian’s attack.

### Turn: Sebastian's frame #3, resuming
- Sebastian’s **Attack**: **R6** vs **W5**: hit for **1 damage die**!
- Sebastian’s **Spot**: **Y6** (spotting Joshua’s mobile frame #1, replacing the standing Y1 with the new Y6)

**End of Sebastian’s turn.**

We’re in combat order **with a mobile frame’s turn still outstanding**, so we resume it.

### Turn: Joshua's frame #2, resuming
- Joshua’s **Attack**: **R6** vs Sebastian’s **W5**: a hit for **1 damage die**!
- Joshua’s Move: G6 (advancing into cover with his mobile frame #1)
- Joshua’s Spot: Y5 (spotting Sebastian’s mobile frame #2, now in range)

**End of Joshua’s turn.**

**There are no mobile frames with turns underway** so combat order ends and we return to tactical order. Sebastian still has the high score so he’s up. He chooses to activate his fourth and last mobile frame.

### Turns continue

**Sebastian’s mobile frame #4 attacks Joshua’s mobile frame #1.** Since it already has a defense number, we don’t switch to combat order. Sebastian’s mobile frame hits it hard for 4 damage dice, falls back slightly, and ends its turn.

**We’re still in tactical order, but all of Sebastian’s mobile frames have taken their turns, so Vincent’s up.** He chooses his mobile frame #2 to attack Joshua's mobile frame #3. We need to know its defense in order to resolve the attack, so we switch to combat order.

**Joshua’s hands are a bit tied. Vincent keeps attacking him, but he needs to concentrate fire on Sebastian or let Sebastian win.** He names Sebastian’s mobile frame #3 as his target and rolls his dice.

As soon as we know his defense number we switch back to Vincent’s mobile frame #2's turn to resolve its attack. It doesn't hit, and again holds its position. Its turn ends.

We resume Joshua's mobile frame #3's turn. Sebastian's mobile frame #3, its target, already has a defense number, so we resolve that attack now, a hit for 1 damage die and a hit that destroys the tree it’s taking cover from. Joshua's mobile frame #3 advances into the open, lights it up with a bright Y6, and its turn ends.

There are no turns underway so we return to tactical order. Sebastian’s mobile frames have all had their turns, so Vincent’s up. He chooses his mobile frame #3 and **names Sebastian’s mobile frame #3, beautifully illuminated by Joshua’s spot**, as his target. He rolls his dice, advances into range, and hits it for a potentially devastating 5 damage dice. He spots it in turn with a Y4 and his turn ends.

We’re still in tactical order. **Vincent has one frame left, but he chooses to pass.**

Joshua’s up, and **since there are no frames to go after his, he can’t pass**. He chooses his mobile frame #4 and names Sebastian’s wounded, exposed mobile frame #3 as his target. He rolls his dice, advances, and delivers the death blow in the form of a 3 damage die hit that came up 5 5 6. Sebastian's mobile frame #3 is destroyed, so we **take a quick pause to recalculate his score**. Now he holds 5 assets, each worth 7, for 35 points--he's lost the lead to Vincent's 36! He promises himself never, ever again to advance when his plan is to fall back.

That done, Joshua's mobile frame #4 drops a weak spot on Vincent's mobile frame #3 and its turn ends.

We’re still in tactical order. Vincent chooses to take his last mobile frame’s turn, naming Joshua's mobile frame #5 as his target. His roll won’t let him advance into range, though, so he loses his attack, instead advancing slightly into better cover.

Joshua's mobile frame #5 is the only one left. Joshua names Vincent’s mobile frame #3 as his target, advances, and with the spot manages to hit for 1 damage die.

**All the mobile frames have had their turns, so the round ends.**

### Round 1 ends

**The Doomsday Clock ticks down 1 by itself, from 11 to 10.**

**Vincent has the highest score** now, 36, so he chooses first: **tick it down to 9?** Yes!

**Sebastian has the second highest score**, 35, so he chooses next: **tick it down to 8?** He cautiously chooses not to.

**Joshua has the third highest score**, 21, so he chooses next: **tick it down to 8?** No!

We **tidy the field**, pulling off all the blue defense dice and unused yellow spot dice, and it's time for round 2. **Round 2 starts, as always, in tactical order.** Vincent has **the highest score, so he's up first**...
