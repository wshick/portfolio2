# COMPARING COMPANIES
When you meet to play, **compare your companies** to determine each player’s score per asset and tactical position.

## Asset Value
Your **assets** are **your own functional mobile frames**, plus the **stations you control** (your own or seized from your enemies). Each asset you hold is worth a certain number of points to you; this number is called your **score per asset**. Your score per asset depends upon the relative size and strength of the company brought to the field.

**Set your score per asset by comparing your company with your opponents’ before play.**

### Count up:
1. the total number of mobile frames in your company
2. the total number of systems they're carrying

### Then calculate:
1. Your score per asset starts at **5**.
2. **Company size:** Does your company have **the most Mobile Frames?** Subtract 1 from your score per asset. Does your company have the **fewest Mobile Frames?** Add 1 to your score per asset.
3. **Systems carried:** Does your company have the **most systems?** Subtract 1 from your score per asset. Does your company have the **fewest systems?** Add 1 to your score per asset.

**In case of ties,** both players adjust their scores per asset.

**Calculate your score per asset only at the beginning of play.** As you play, you’ll lose mobile frames, and stations will change hands. **This changes how many assets you hold, not your score per asset.**

## Starting Score
$$\mathbf{Your\,Score} = (\mathbf{Number\,of\,Assets}) \times (\mathbf{Score\,per\,Asset})$$
Before play starts, the assets you hold are **your own mobile frames** and **your own stations**. Each one is worth a number of points equal to your **score per asset**.

**The sum is your starting score.**

**Your score per asset does not change** in the course of the game.

## Tactical Position, Offense & Defense
**The player with the highest starting score starts play on the defensive.** You can win by holding on to what you have.

**All the other players start play on the offensive.**

The player with the **lowest starting score** starts play **on point offense**. To win, you have the most to accomplish.

**Compare starting scores** and note your tactical position, whether you’re playing defense, offense, or point. Battlefield setup follows your tactical positions, defense to offense to defense: the defensive player starts, the offensive players alternate turns, starting with the player on point, and the defensive player finishes.

>[!example]+ Example Scores per Asset
> - **Estar's Anvil**, fielded by Joshua, is a UMFL company of **5 Mobile Frames**, all fully outfitted, carrying a total of **20 systems**.
> - **The Sun's Fang**, fielded by Vincent, is a Free Colony company of **4 Mobile Frames**, all fully outfitted, carrying a total of **16 systems**.
> - **The Piercing Eye**, fielded by Sebastian, is an Ijad company of **4 Mobile Frames**, not quite all fully outfitted, carrying a total of **15 systems**.
> 
> **All 3 companies' scores per asset start at 5.**
> 
> **Estar’s Anvil has the most mobile frames**, so its score per asset **goes down to 4**. The other two companies **both have the fewest mobile frames**, so their scores per asset both **go up to 6**.
> 
> **Estar’s Anvil carries the most systems**, so its score per asset **goes down to 3**. **The Piercing Eye carries the fewest**, so its score per asset **goes up to 7**.
> 
> #### Scores per Asset:
> - Estar's Anvil: **3**
> - The Sun's Fang: **6**
> - The Piercing Eye: **7**

>[!example]+ Example Tactical Positions
> Joshua’s company **Estar’s Anvil holds 7 assets**--5 mobile frames, 2 stations--each worth **3 points**, for a starting score of **21**. This is **the lowest starting score**, so J starts play on **point offense**.
> 
> Vincent’s company **The Sun’s Fang holds 6 assets**--4 mobile frames, 2 stations--each worth **6 points**, for a starting score of **36**. V starts play on **offense**.
> 
> Sebastian’s company **The Piercing Eye holds 6 assets**--4 mobile frames, 2 stations--each worth **7 points**, for a starting score of **42**. This is **the highest starting score**, so S starts play on **defense**.
