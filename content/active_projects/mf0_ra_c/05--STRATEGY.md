# STRATEGY
## If you're attacking:
To win, you’ll have to **destroy your enemies’ mobile frames** and **seize their stations** without losing many or any of your own. **Attack immediately, hard, and follow through as strongly as you are able.**

**Pay close attention to everyone’s current scores.** Odds are that the player with the highest score will change midbattle. Be prepared.

If you take the highest score, you’ll need to play defense now, because you’ll be the big target on the battlefield. If you see it coming, you can **try to consolidate your position beforehand**.

**If an erstwhile ally takes the highest score**, that player takes the defense and you’ll need to **switch your attack** to that player’s company. **Continuing the fight against your old enemy will only help your new enemy to win.** If you see it coming, you can **try to conserve your momentum by setting up your new assault beforehand**.

## If you're defending:
To win, you won’t strictly have to hold onto everything you have, you’ll only have to **inflict losses as great as you suffer**.

**It might be to your advantage to give a station away earlier in the game**, shifting the high score and the defense to another player. **Consider making an early sacrifice** to preserve your strength for a comeback.

**When you lose the high score and the defense shifts to another player, announce it to the table!** Get those attackers off your back.
