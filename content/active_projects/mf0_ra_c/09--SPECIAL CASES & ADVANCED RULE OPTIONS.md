# SPECIAL CASES & ADVANCED RULE OPTIONS
## Ties for Defense
When you compare your companies during setup, you might **tie for the highest** starting score. When this happens, call odds-evens and roll a die.

If you’re the winner, choose whether to
- add a mobile frame to your company
- remove a mobile frame from your company
- force the loser to make the same choice

Recompare companies to recalculate scores per asset, then recalculate starting scores. Proceed.

If you think you might tie, be sure to bring a spare mobile frame to the game with you!

## Ties for Offense
When you compare your companies during setup, you might **tie for the lowest** starting score. When this happens, call odds-evens and roll a die.

If you’re the loser:
- you have to place the point mobile frame.
- you go last in tactical order, until your scores change so there’s no longer a tie.

Proceed.

## Contested Stations
In a game with 3 or more players, it’s possible to lose one of your stations without any opponent getting to seize it under one circumstance:
1. You have a mobile frame within hand to hand range of a station you own;
2. Two or more of your opponents have also moved mobile frames into hand to hand range of the station;
3. Your mobile frame departs, either by moving away to abandon the station or by getting destroyed.

When this happens, your opponents both have mobile frames who could seize the station, but neither can seize it because the other’s contesting it. You lose the station, but neither of them get it until they resolve their standoff.

Recalculate your own score now to reflect the loss of your station. Don’t recalculate your opponent’s score until it’s resolved.

## Aborting an Attack
When you’ve declared an attack on a target, after you’ve rolled your dice, you can choose not to make the attack after all. You might choose to do this if, looking at the numbers, you don’t think your attack will be effective enough and you’d rather not switch to combat order and give the target frame its turn just yet.

Once you've chosen an attack number and told it to your target, it’s too late to take it back.

An attack of 0 is the same as no attack. You don’t need to know your target’s defense in order to resolve it, so don’t switch to combat order. An attack of 1 does count as an attack, because of the (sometimes merely technical) possibility that your target will have a defense of 0.

## Split-Range Weapons
With everyone’s approval, you can declare your weapon systems to be **split-range**. A split-range pistol, for instance, might add 1 red die at direct fire and 1 red die at hand-to-hand, instead of 2 red dice at either. A split-range assault rifle with a scope might add 1 red die at direct fire range and 1 red die at artillery range.

For purposes of building your frames, a split weapon counts as 2 half0systems, one of each type. A split hand-to-hand/direct weapon counts as half a hand-to-hand weapon system and half a direct fire weapon system, for instance. You still aren’t allowed to have more than 2 systems of each type.

## Single-Shot Rockets
Every company must carry the same number of single-shot rockets. By default, every company must carry 3.

Before you create your companies, you can agree as a group to some other number. Fewer, down to 0, will make the battle closer and harder-fought, with the attacker at a disadvantage. More--up to, say, 6 or 8--will make the battle bloodier and more uncertain, with the attacker at the advantage.

## Climbing, Elevation, and Falling
Before you field your companies, you can agree as a group to allow climbing.

Mobile frames can gain benefit from climbing onto structures if they're at least 6 bricks high and at least 4 studs in area.

When a mobile frame moves, climbing up or down 6 bricks' height counts the same as moving 1 ruler unit horizontally. To climb, a mobile frame has to have at least one appropriate movement system. A mobile frame with no movement systems can climb stairs or a ladder, if it's built into the structure.

A higher mobile frame is in cover to all lower mobile frames. A lower mobile frame is out of cover to any higher mobile frames, unless it's under a roof. Mobile frames at the same elevation determine cover normally.

Don't consider elevation differences of less than 6 bricks' height.

If a mobile frame falls--if, for instance, the structure it's standing on is destroyed underneath it--it can take damage. Roll 1 damage die for every 3 bricks' height it's fallen, and use damage chart 1: hand-to-hand attacks.

## Exotic Terrain and Environmental Systems
Before you create your companies, you can agree as a group to include hostile terrain--deep water, tangleweed, the vacuum of orbit--in your upcoming battlefield.

When you build your mobile frames, you can give them the appropriate environmental system. It counts against your limit of 4 systems per mobile frame.

In order to function effectively in hostile terrain, a mobile frame needs the appropriate environmental system. Without it, when you roll dice, set one of your white dice aside unrolled.

## Per-Unit Turn Order
As a group, you can decide to play with per-unit order instead of tactical order.

At the beginning of the round, roll 20-sided dice for your mobile frames’ turn order.

A fully-fitted mobile frame--one with 4 systems--gets 1 20-sided die for turn order.

An underfitted mobile frame--one designed with 3 or fewer systems--gets 2 20-sided dice for turn order.

Roll the dice in order and place them out on the battlefield next to their mobile frames.

The round starts at turn order 1 and counts up to 20. A mobile frame takes its turn when its turn order comes (or in combat order, as always).

A mobile frame with 2 score dice gets its turn at whichever you prefer, case by case, as they come. It still gets only one turn in the round.

Per-unit turn order adds significant time to the game, but also adds interesting tactical constraints.
