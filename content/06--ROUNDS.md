# ROUNDS
Play the battle out over a number of **rounds**, counting down to **doomsday**.

## In a Round
**Each Mobile Frame gets one turn.** During the round, you’ll **switch back and forth between tactical order and combat order**. The round ends when the last mobile frame’s taken its turn.

As you destroy each others’ mobile frames and seize each others’ stations, keep a running score:
$$\mathbf{Score} = \mathbf{Number\,of\,Assets} \times \mathbf{Score\,per\,Asset}$$

As your scores change, the player with the highest score always takes the defense. After each Mobile Frame has taken its turn, end the round by picking up remaining dice and counting down to doomsday.

## Tactical Order
The round begins in tactical order.

**In tactical order, always start with the player with the highest score.**

**When you have the highest score**, you can either:
- **choose one** of your available mobile frames and take its turn
- **pass** to the player with the next-highest score. **That player then has the same choice**, and potentially the next player too, down to the player with the lowest score.

**However:**
- **if all of your mobile frames have already taken their turns this round**, you have to pass
- **if there are no mobile frames left to go after you**, you have to take a turn.

**When a mobile frame takes its turn, resolve it**--this may include switching to combat order--**and then return to tactical order**, beginning again with the player with the current highest score.

## Combat Order
When one mobile frame attacks a mobile frame that hasn’t taken its turn yet, **switch to combat order**.

**In combat order**, the attacking and defending mobile frames’ turns overlap.
1. The **attacker takes the first part** of its turn, pausing to find the defender's defense value
2. The **defender rolls** and chooses a defense value
3. The **attacker finishes its turn**
4. Then the **defender finishes its turn**, including any movement and attacks of its own.

This counts as the defending mobile frame’s turn for this round, naturally.

As defenders in turn attack targets of their own, combat order can cascade through a series of mobile frames’ turns.

Once the cascade is done, return to tactical order to continue the round.

## Seizing Stations
At the beginning of play, you control all your own stations. They remain yours even if you don’t have any mobile frames anywhere near them, unless or until another player seizes them.

**To seize a station from another player, you have to get one or more of your mobile frames within hand to hand range of the station** while no other player has a mobile frame of their own within hand to hand range of it. This can happen during any mobile frame’s turn:
- On your own mobile frame's turn, when your opponent has left the station unguarded, and you move one of your mobile frames into hand to hand range of it
- On your opponent's mobile frame's turn, when you and your opponent both have a mobile frame in hand to hand range of the station, and your opponent’s frame moves away, abandoning the station to you.
- On any mobile frame's turn, when you and your opponent both have a mobile frame in hand to hand range of the station, and your opponent’s frame gets destroyed by incoming attacks

Once you've seized a station, it remains yours until someone else seizes it from you. You don’t have to keep any mobile frames near it to keep ownership of it.

## Running Score
The moment that **any mobile frame is destroyed**, recount that player’s score.

The moment that **any mobile frame seizes a station**, recount both players’ score.
$$\mathbf{Score} = \mathbf{Number\,of\,Assets} \times \mathbf{Score\,per\,Asset}$$

**Your assets** are your undestroyed Mobile Frames and the stations you control.

**Destroying someone else’s mobile frame** costs them points equal to their score per asset.

**Seizing their station** costs them points equal to their score per asset and gains you points equal to your own score per asset.

**In tactical order, always start with the player with the current highest score.** As your scores change, your tactical order changes too, right then.

## Tidying the Battlefield
During the round, you’ll be placing defense dice and spot dice next to the mobile frames. **At the end of the round, pull them all off the field.**

Leave the debris and carnage, though.

## Counting Down to Doomsday
**At the end of the round**, count the doomsday clock down 1.

Then call on each player in tactical order, **from highest current score to lowest**: Each player has the option to **count the doomsday clock down by 1**, or to pass.

**If you’re winning**--or think you’ll be winning soon--you can speed the battle toward its end.

**If you’re losing**, it’s not to your advantage to do so.
