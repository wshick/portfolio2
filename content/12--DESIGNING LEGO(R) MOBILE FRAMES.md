# DESIGNING LEGO(R) MOBILE FRAMES
BY SOREN ROBERTS

## Design
### Basic Design
"Readability" in a model is a problem a lot of manufacturers of traditional wargaming stuff have dealt with (to varying degrees of success). Make weapons, shields, sensors, and other attachments visually distinct from one another--if two weapon designs are hard to tell apart, make them serve the same function--and err on the side of making systems too large rather than too small. Not only will it be easier to tell what your units have, but you’re less likely to lose attachments you’ve removed.

### The 3-1-1 Rule
Most companies in MFZ fall somewhere in the range of 4-7 units. Within that range, 5 seems to be a good planning size--big enough for some variety, small enough that taking any one design out isn’t crippling.

When designing a company, I start by figuring out what I want my "grunt" to be. This is the robot that I expect to execute my core strategy with--if that means capturing stations in hand-to-hand fighting, or gunning down enemy fast attackers at direct range, I design these guys to do it. Visually and mechanically, I try to get 3 identical units. If I have to expand or reduce my army, I can add to or reduce the number of these guys without losing any essential functions. Their redundancy also makes them easier to risk in combat: losing any one of them isn’t a big deal.

The other two are my specialists. Scouts, dedicated artillery, heavily armored defenders--I try to make them visually distinct from the other three and from each other. Even more important than being distinct from the enemy, it helps if I can instantly tell them apart and note their functions. The pairing of scout/artillery, in particular, is extremely easy to track when using very small scouts and very large artillerists--I can see at a glance which unit is where.
