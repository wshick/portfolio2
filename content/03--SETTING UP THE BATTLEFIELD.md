# SETTING UP THE BATTLEFIELD
When you meet to play, set up the battlefield. Build terrain out of LEGO(R) bricks, recalling that any object 3 bricks high or taller is cover.

## Terrain
**Cover your table with terrain.** Give it a good assortment of cover, with some wide avenues, some snipers' nests, some culs-de-sac, some killing grounds, and no-man's-lands.

**Every player has to approve the layout of the battlefield** before you begin fielding your companies. Any player can adjust the battlefield layout until all are satisfied with it.

## The Ruler, Ranges, and Cover
By default, for typical dining room tables, play with **a ruler 8 units long**, with each unit being 5 studs, 5cm, or 2".

**Your table should measure 4-6 rulers’ lengths** diagonally and circular or square. If it’s bigger or smaller, adjust accordingly:

**If your table is bigger**, increase each unit to 6 or 7 cm, 6 or 7 studs, or 3", or else tape off the edges or corners of your table.

**If your table is much smaller**, decrease the ruler to 6 units long.

- **Hand-to-hand range** is 1 ruler unit or closer.
- **Direct fire range** is outside of hand-to-hand range, out to the length of the ruler (8 units, usually).
- **Artillery range** is any distance outside the length of the ruler.

**Ranges are exclusive.** You can't use a direct fire weapon system at hand-to-hand range (that is, at a distance of only 1 ruler unit), nor an artillery weapon system at hand-to-hand or direct fire range (that is, at any distance within the length of the ruler).

Measure the physical space between the mobile frames at their closest. If the ruler can touch both Mobile Frames, it's direct fire range; if it can't, it's artillery range.

**Any structure on the battlefield is cover if it’s 3 bricks or more high, except stations.** All standing mobile frames count as cover.

**A mobile frame is in cover** against an attacker if:
- it is **within hand to hand range of cover**
- the cover is **between it and its attacker**, in whole or in part

**The only cover that matters is cover within arm’s reach of the defender.** If there’s cover anywhere else between the attacker and defender, but not within hand to hand range of the defender, ignore it.

Don’t consider line of sight, only the defender’s cover and the range of the attack.
