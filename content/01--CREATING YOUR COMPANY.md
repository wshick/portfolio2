# CREATING YOUR COMPANY
In the days before you play, **create your company**.

## Company Size
Your company is made of two kinds of units: **[[#Stations|stations]]** and **[[#Mobile Frames|mobile frames]]**. The minimum and maximum number of units in your company depends on the number of players and whether you’re playing a **skirmish** or **battle**.

| Players | Stations | Mobile Frames (Skirmish) | Mobile Frames (Battle) |
|:-------:|:--------:|:------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|    2    |    3     |           4-6            |          5-8           |
|    3    |    2     |           3-5            |          4-7           |
|    4    |    2     |           3-4            |          4-6           |
|    5    |    1     |           3-4            |          3-5           |

Your company must also carry **3 [[#Single-Shot Rockets|single-shot rockets]]**.

When you bring your company to the field, you’ll compare it with your fellow players’. **The player with the smallest, weakest company** gets the score advantage and starts the battle on the defensive. **The player with the largest, most powerful company** gets a score penalty and starts the battle on the offensive.

You’ll have to second-guess your opponents while you’re designing your company to get the position you hope for. **The most advantageous companies** are:
- very slightly smaller and weaker than your opponent’s, so that you seize the point advantage at little tactical cost; or
- much larger and stronger than your opponent’s, so that you cede the point advantage but with a great tactical advantage.

## Stations
A station must:
- be **stationary**, hence the name
- be **distinct** from the local terrain, so nobody will get confused about what is and what isn’t
- have a place to clip on a little flag
- be **no bigger than 4x4 studs**. If you want to use something larger, designate the part that is a station; the rest is regular cover.

For your stations, you can build anything that’s stationary and valuable to defend or seize. The door panel on a drop ship, a cache of medical supplies, a civilian scientist and her family, a research facility’s data storage drives, a truck with a flat tire and a load of fresh peaches. Whatever.

## Mobile Frames
A mobile frame consists of a **frame** and a variety of **[[#Systems|systems]]**. A frame can carry at most a **total of 4 systems. No more than 2 systems can be any given type**, but frames are otherwise allowed to carry any mix of systems you want.

Absent systems, a mobile frame can do four things:
1. Defend itself
2. Move, navigating around cover
3. Spot a target who is within direct fire range and not in cover
4. Attack a target at hand-to-hand range

### The Dice
Each mobile frame provides **2 white dice**. Additionally, you may add dice for each system.
- **Red dice** are for **attacking.**
- **Green dice** are for **moving.**
- **Blue dice** are for **defending.**
- **Yellow dice** are for **spotting** targets for other mobile frames to attack.
- **White dice** are **wild**; use them for any of the above.

### Systems
There are 6 types of systems:

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 **defensive systems**: armor, a shield, camouflage, stealth composite surfacing, ECM. The first defensive system adds 1 blue die. The second defensive system adds a second blue die and allows the mobile frame to act as cover to other mobile frames without risking damage itself.

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 **movement systems**: jumpjets, wings, wheels. Each movement system adds 1 green die. Using any movement system at all allows the mobile frame to move through cover; otherwise, it has to go around it.

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 **surveillance/communications systems**: a radio, a targeting laser, spotlights, a rifle scope. Each comms system adds 1 yellow die. Without any comms systems, the mobile frame can spot targets only within direct fire range and out of cover. With 1 comms system, the mobile frame can spot targets within direct fire range, but in cover. With 2 comms systems, the mobile frame can spot targets anywhere on the battlefield.

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 **hand-to-hand weapon systems**: a shock baton, a combat knife, a repurposed jackhammer. The first adds 2 red dice at hand-to-hand range. The second adds 1 red 8-sided die at hand-to-hand range.

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 **direct fire weapon systems**: an assault rifle, a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a beam weapon. The first adds 2 red dice at direct fire range. The second adds 1 red 8-sided die at direct fire range.

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 **artillery range weapon systems**: a mortar, a sniper rifle, a railgun. The first adds 2 red dice at artillery range. The second adds 1 red 8-sided die at artillery range.

Weapon ranges are exclusive. You can't attack with a direct fire weapon when you're in hand-to-hand range, and you can't attack with an artillery range weapon when you're within direct fire range.

### Sprinting
A mobile frame can carry **at most 4 systems.**

**A mobile frame with neither direct fire nor artillery range weapons systems** gets 1 green 8-sided die as well. **This doesn't count as a system** and can't be destroyed.

### Single-Shot Rockets
In addition to its frame and systems, **a mobile frame can also carry up to 3 single-shot rockets.**

A single-shot rocket provides **1 red d8 at direct fire range**, once only. Discard it after you use it.

**Your company must carry exactly 3** single-shot rockets.

### The "Soldier" Configuration
A soldier-configured frame carries one defensive system, one movement system, one comms system, and one direct fire weapon system. Every other mobile frame is a specialist of some sort. When you're creating your frames, an easy way to start is to make a soldier configuration and then swap systems in and out to specialize as needed.

### Die configuration notation:
Each system’s dice are noted as the number of dice (**1**, **2**, or **3**), the color of die (**R**, **Y**, **G**, or **B**), the range at which that die takes effect (**h**, **d**, and **a** for hand-to-hand, direct, and artillery), and if it gives a bonus attack **d8** for either acting as a second weapon at a range or a bonus movement d8 for a frame unencumbered with ranged weapons at all.
> [!example]+
> **2Rd** is a direct-range weapon, whereas **2Ra & d8** is a double-barreled artillery piece or perhaps a rifle with a scope mounted. **1G** is a movement system such as a jetpack or tracked feet, **1Y** is a sensor/comms system like a radio or night scope while and **1B** is a defensive system like armor or stealth cladding. **Gd8** is a bonus green d8 for a frame with no ranged weapons. **1Rd & 1Rh** is a carbine with a bayonet, with one die at both direct and hand-to hand range.
